<p><strong><b>Privacy Policy for Random Daily Exercise app</b></strong></p>
<p>Effective Date: 27.12.2024</p>
<p>At kmal labs, we are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring that your personal information remains safe. This privacy policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your data when using our mobile app. Please read this policy carefully.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong> Data Collection</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Random Daily Exercise app generates random exercises each day and collects the history of exercises you perform. All data is stored locally on your device, and no information is transmitted to any external servers. The only data the app collects and stores is related to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Exercise history</strong>: The list of exercises you have performed over time.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Exercise settings</strong>: The list of exercises selected to use as exercise pool and the preferred number of repetitions of duration per exercise.</li>
</ul>
<p>We do not collect any personally identifiable information, and the data is only used to enhance your user experience by providing daily exercises and tracking your progress.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong> Data Use</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Exercise Recommendations</strong>: The app generates daily random exercises for you based on previous interactions, but the data used for generating these recommendations remains local to your device.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tracking Progress</strong>: The app records your exercise history to help you track your progress over time, though this history is not currently visible to you within the app.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Customization</strong>: Based on your exercise history, the app may adjust future exercise recommendations to better match your preferences.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong> Data Storage</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>All data related to exercise history is stored <strong>locally</strong> on your device. The app does <strong>not</strong> send any data to external servers or cloud storage. You have full control over the data stored in the app, and it remains private to you and only accessible through the app on your device.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong> Data Retention</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The app retains your exercise history for as long as you use it. If you choose to delete the app or clear its data, all exercise history and logs will be permanently removed from your device.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong> Data Security</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>We take reasonable measures to protect your data from unauthorized access. However, because the data is stored locally on your device, it is also subject to the security of your device itself. Please ensure that your device is secured with a password, fingerprint, or other security measures to prevent unauthorized access to your app&rsquo;s data.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li><strong> No Third-Party Access</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>We do <strong>not</strong> share, sell, or transfer any of your data to third parties. Since all data is stored locally on your device, there is no external access to your exercise history. Additionally, we do not integrate with any third-party services for data collection or analytics.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li><strong> Your Rights</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>You have full control over the data stored in the app. You can:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Delete your exercise history</strong> by clearing the app data using Android OS built-in app management capabilities.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Uninstall the app</strong> at any time, which will remove all local data from your device.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="8">
<li><strong> Changes to This Privacy Policy</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time to reflect changes in our app's features or data practices. Any changes will be reflected in the updated privacy policy within the app. We encourage you to review this policy periodically for any updates.</p>
<ol start="9">
