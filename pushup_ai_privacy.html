<p><strong><b>Privacy Policy for Push-up AI app</b></strong></p>
<p>Effective Date:	09.03.2025</p>
<p>At kmal labs, we are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring that your personal information remains safe. This privacy policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your data when using our mobile app. Please read this policy carefully.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong> Data Collection</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Push-up AI app tracks your movement with camera and collects the history of exercises you perform. All data is stored locally on your device, and no information is transmitted to any external servers. The only data the app collects and stores is related to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Exercise history</strong>: Data related to push-ups you have performed over time.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Training plan</strong>: Data related to your personalized training plan created for you by the app.</li>
</ul>
<p>We do not collect any video data or any personally identifiable information, and the data is only used to enhance your user experience by providing training plan and tracking your progress.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong> Data Use</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Training Plan Generation</strong>: The app generates training plans for you based on interactions, but the data used for generating these plans remains local to your device.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tracking Progress</strong>: The app records your exercise history to help you track your progress over time. This data is stored only locally. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Camera Feed Usage</strong>: The camera feed is used exclusively to track your movement, analyze your pose, count push-ups, and provide real-time feedback on exercise form. No video files are recorded or stored, as all processing occurs instantly on your device.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong> Data Storage</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>All data related to training plans and exercise history is stored <strong>locally</strong> on your device. The app does <strong>not</strong> send any data to external servers or cloud storage. You have full control over the data stored in the app, and it remains private to you and only accessible through the app on your device.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong> Data Retention</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The app retains your training plan and exercise history for as long as you use it. If you choose to delete the app or clear its data, all exercise history and training plan will be permanently removed from your device.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong> Data Security</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>We take reasonable measures to protect your data from unauthorized access. However, because the data is stored locally on your device, it is also subject to the security of your device itself. Please ensure that your device is secured with a password, fingerprint, or other security measures to prevent unauthorized access to your app&rsquo;s data.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li><strong> No Third-Party Access</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>We do <strong>not</strong> share, sell, or transfer any of your data to third parties. Since all data is stored locally on your device, there is no external access to your exercise history. Additionally, we do not integrate with any third-party services for data collection or analytics.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li><strong> Your Rights</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>You have full control over the data stored in the app. You can:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Delete your exercise history</strong> by clearing the app data using Android OS built-in app management capabilities.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Uninstall the app</strong> at any time, which will remove all local data from your device.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="8">
<li><strong> Changes to This Privacy Policy</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time to reflect changes in our app's features or data practices. Any changes will be reflected in the updated privacy policy within the app. We encourage you to review this policy periodically for any updates.</p>
